> [!NOTE]
> The exercises here have been converted from Python to Hy. Currently a work in progress.

### Running Tests
The `conftest.py` and `pytest.ini` files allow you to write and run tests in Hy and are taken straight from the [documentation](https://github.com/hylang/hy/wiki/Compatibility-tips#pytest).

`pytest test_difference_of_squares.hy --assert=plain`
